##Â Notes

### SLF4J
Processes' Groovy script are using SLF4J to produce log messages. SLF4J is not embedded by default in Studio classloader. This explains why you need to import it manually. Note that the library is provided by Bonita BPM web application and so does not need to be embedded as process dependency.
