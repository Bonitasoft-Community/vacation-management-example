. Start Bonita BPM Studio 7.4.3 or later
. Download the https://github.com/Bonitasoft-Community/vacation-management-example/releases[application bundle]
. Extract the bundle to a temporary folder
. Import the .bos file in your Bonita BPM Studio. It contains 5 diagrams: Example-NewVacationRequest, Example-ModifyPendingVacationRequest, Example-CancelVacationRequest, Example-InitiateVacationAvailable and Example-RemoveAllBusinessData. Each diagram includes a single process definition. It also includes business data model definition, default process configuration and application page (i.e. application user interface definition). *Important*: importing the `.bos` file will ask you to override your existing business data model.
. Open the Example-InitiateVacationAvailable diagram and run the process (click on "Run" button in a Bonita BPM Studio). This process will initialize a business data that store vacation available counter for each Bonita BPM user declared in the default test environment (ACME organization).

Note that vacation request approval need to be performed by requester (walter.bates) manager (helen.kelly) so you might want to logout and login back with helen.kelly/bpm user.
